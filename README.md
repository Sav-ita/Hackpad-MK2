# Hackpad MK2

This repository contains all files for the **Hackpad MK2** project, a custom 9-key macro pad designed for productivity and customization.

It features:
- 3x3 mechanical keys (9 total)
- 0.91" OLED display (SSD1306)
- Powered by an RP2040 microcontroller (compatible with CircuitPython)

## Schematic
![Schematic Screenshot](Images/4.png) 

The schematic, designed in KiCad, shows the wiring for the 9 independent keys and the I2C OLED display. Each key is connected to a dedicated GPIO on the RP2040, and the OLED follows the GND-VCC-SCL-SDA pinout.

## PCB Layout
The PCB was designed focusing on a clean layout and easy assembly. It includes custom silkscreen labeling and broad copper traces for reliability.
